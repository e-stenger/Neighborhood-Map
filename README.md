# Neighborhood-Map

My neighborhood map is a virtual tour of the Pyramids of Giza. Links to sites for more information and 
photos. 3rd part api foursquare used to get pictures (picture)

3rd part api foursquare functionally did not do what i wanted for this project. It was a good learning 
experience though for sure. The final submission uses wikipedia to pull image and extract information 
specific to each site.
